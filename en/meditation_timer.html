            <h2>About the App</h2>
            <img src="/images/meditation_timer/meditation_timer_icon.png" alt="Still Time app icon" class="app-icon">
            <p>"Still Time" is a meditation timer app for Android devices, designed to support pure meditation experiences by eliminating unnecessary elements.</p>
            <p>As someone who meditates regularly, I found that most smartphone timer apps had sounds that were too loud or kept ringing indefinitely, which didn't feel appropriate for ending a meditation session. This inspired me to create this app.</p>
            <p>Additionally, many free apps include advertisements, which means seeing ads before and after meditation. I believe this negatively impacts the benefits of meditation practice.</p>

            <h3>Meditation-Focused Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Customizable time settings: Users can assign their preferred meditation durations to buttons.</li>
                <li>Gentle notification: A quiet "bell sound" rings just once to signal completion.</li>
                <li>Ad-free experience: No advertisements to disturb your focus before or after meditation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- How to Use -->
        <section id="how-to-use">
            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <h3>Basic Usage</h3>
            <p><strong>Select meditation time</strong><br>Choose your meditation duration from the buttons at the bottom of the screen. Default options include 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Start meditation</strong><br>Press the "Start" button to begin. Beautiful ripple animations will appear, moving in harmony with natural breathing rhythm (6 seconds expanding, 5 seconds contracting).</p>
            <p><strong>Focus on meditation</strong><br>If desired, gaze at the ripple animation while focusing on your natural breath. The app automatically prevents screen sleep so you can concentrate on your practice.</p>
            <p><strong>Meditation complete</strong><br>When the set time ends, a gentle bell sound will notify you, and the app automatically returns to the initial screen.</p>

            <h3>Customization Features</h3>
            <p>You can customize meditation times from the settings screen. Access the gear icon to set any duration from 1 to 99 minutes. Save up to 5 custom time settings.</p>

            <h3>Operation Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>During meditation, use "Stop" to pause or "Reset" to restart</li>
                <li>The app supports both Japanese and English, automatically switching based on your device settings</li>
                <li>Designed with simple operations to help you focus on meditation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            <p>Screen display: Please keep the screen visible during meditation. If your smartphone enters sleep mode, the timer may not function properly. While the app includes features to prevent automatic sleep during meditation, we recommend keeping the screen active for reliable operation.</p>

            <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
            <p>This app embodies not only convenience but also a spirit of gratitude and sharing. In a society where excessive capitalism burdens many people, rather than simply following that flow, I offer this app as my personal challenge to circulate value in a more human-centered way.</p>
            <p>When you feel "I want to support this app," I would be grateful if you could express that sentiment through your support.</p>
