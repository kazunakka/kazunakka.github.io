Thank you for using the app.

Until now, this app has been known by two names: "Watashi-jikan" (My Time) in Japanese and "Still Time" in English. Moving forward, I have decided to unify the app name to "Still Time."

Initially, I named it "Watashi-jikan" in Japanese with the hope that users would spend time being their "true selves" through meditation. I chose "Still Time" for English speakers to convey that same essence.

However, I recently had a realization. Using the term "true self" felt as if I were implying the existence of a "false self" as an opposite. I began to feel that such a dualistic way of thinking doesn't capture the true essence of our existence.

As long as I exist in this world, I am always my "true self." With this realization, I came to believe that what truly matters in meditation is simply having a quiet, still moment to be with oneself.

I considered changing the Japanese name to "Shizuka-jikan" (Quiet Time), but I felt that the name "Still Time" fits my current perspective most naturally.

Thank you for your continued support of "Still Time."
