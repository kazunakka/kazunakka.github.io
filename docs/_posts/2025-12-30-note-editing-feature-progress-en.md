Hello everyone! We are currently taking on the challenge of implementing an **editing feature** for the notes in the Still Time app.

Since app development for me is a process of learning through trial and error, I kindly ask for your patience as we work on this. However, this is a feature I personally wanted to use, so I'm dedicated to making it happen!

Please look forward to this new enhancement. Thank you for your continued support!
